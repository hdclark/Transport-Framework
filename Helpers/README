 These Lua scripts use hard-coded references to log files in /tmp/. They can be run from any
directory. They spit their output to the same directory.

 Modify them as needed for other simulations. They are not really designed to be as flexible
as the rest of Project - Transport because many types of analysis could be done on the output
data. For instance, Brachytherapy simulation would not follow the same data flow as CT 
reconstruction, arbitrary dose delivery, or linac wasteage simulation.
