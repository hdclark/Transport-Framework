Timing fitted/linear/cpslines water interpolation - 1000000 photons - Electron localdumps.

   fitted:       (This is the worst-looking data. Flat regions are well approximated, but any curvature is poorly handled.)
real	1m15.928s
user	1m15.645s
sys	0m0.273s


   linear:       (This data looks fairly good - a little 'parabolic'-like in some areas (mostly low energy)
real	0m54.420s
user	0m54.150s
sys	0m0.267s


    csplines:    (This data looks fairly good. It is complementary to the linear interpolation. Also has some curvature issues. Curvature might be in inconvenient/dangerous locations. Test it!)
real	0m56.475s
user	0m56.226s

Timing for 2 million photons in infinite water tank on laptop (one core)

[hal@Crushernator Project - Transport]$ time ./transport

real	12m51.554s
user	9m8.394s
sys	3m17.104s
                             be careful, though. Memory usage on the laptop was up to  ~50% !
                             ALSO note that over 700 MB of data was written. Make sure /tmp/ can handle it!
